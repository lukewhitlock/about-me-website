                <p>I exhibit strong communication skills.</p>
                <p>I love to meet new people, and am both a leader and a listener.</p>
                <p>I speak with clarity and confidence, and am comfortable 
                    with asking for help when necessary.</p>
                <p>I have debate experience, competing in numerous tournaments, 
                    and so I am proficient in public speaking, logic, and preparation.</p>

                <p>I am a confident and considerate leader.</p>
                <p>I have strong communication skills, and am comfortable with holding 
                    myself and others accountable for our actions.</p>
                <p>I can be the world's biggest hypeman, building others up, 
                    while still being stern when necessary.</p>
                <p>I understand the importance of acting with integrity and humility, 
                    and putting trust into others.</p>
                <p>I was the leader of my section in marching band 
                    and an officer of my high school's code base club.</p>

                <p>When I commit to something, I can be counted on to stick with it 
                    until the job is complete.</p>
                <p>I reliably give everything my maximum effort and persevere 
                    even through difficult circumstances.</p>
                <p>I exhibit this skill in both the workplace and my daily life, 
                    such as my commitment to the gym or to marching band.</p>
