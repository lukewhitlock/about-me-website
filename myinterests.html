            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>I've been a big reader since I was a kid. 
                I particularly love fantasy, with some of my favorites 
                being books by Brandon Sanderson and the Dandelion Dynasty series.
                I'm a sucker for anything that's more character focused.

            <h2>Climbing</h2>
            <p>I've been getting into bouldering recently.
                It's been a ton of fun and a great way to exercise!
                I'm probably at the level of a v4 climber currently.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I like most music, but I mostly listen to alternative styles.
                My favorite band is Paramore, and I really love Hayley William's solo work.
                I'm also a big fan of The Marias and more R&B styled music.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>I like to play video games in my down time. My favorites are single-player games
                like Elden Ring or Hollow Knight, but I also like to play games like Valorant
                with my friends.

            <h2>Shows</h2>
            <p>I watch a good amount of shows. Most recently, I finished Modern Family and Pluribus,
                which I both really enjoyed.
