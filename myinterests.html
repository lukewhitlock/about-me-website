                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>I've been a big reader since I was a kid. 
                    I particularly love fantasy, with some of my favorites 
                    being books by Brandon Sanderson and the Dandelion Dynasty series.
                    I'm a sucker for anything that's more character focused.

                <h2>Climbing</h2>
                <p>I've been getting into bouldering recently.
                    It's been a ton of fun and a great way to exercise!
                    I'm probably at the level of a v4 climber currently.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>I like most music, but I mostly listen to alternative styles.
                    My favorite band is Paramore, and I really love Hayley William's solo work.
                    I'm also a big fan of The Marias and more R&B styled music.

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>I like to play video games in my down time. My favorites are single-player games
                    like Elden Ring or Hollow Knight, but I also like to play games like Valorant
                    with my friends.

               <h2>Shows</h2>
                <p>I watch a good amount of shows. Most recently I finished Modern Family and Pluribus,
                    which I both really enjoyed. I also watched Tatsuki Fujimoto's 17-26, which I loved.
